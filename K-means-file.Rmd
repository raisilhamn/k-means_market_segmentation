This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
library(VIM)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(factoextra)

```

```{r}
df <- read.csv(file = 'black_friday_2.csv')
glimpse(df)
out<-data.matrix(df)
df_final <- as.data.frame(out)
```

```{r}
#  Data before normalization. 
aggr(df_final)
```

```{r}
# Data After normalization
df_clean <- df_final
sum(is.na(df_clean))
df_clean<- (df_clean)
colSums(is.na(df_clean))
df_clean <- na.omit(df_clean)
aggr(df_clean)
```



```{r}
fviz_nbclust(df_clean, kmeans, method = "wss")
fviz_nbclust(df, kmeans, method = "silhouette")
```







Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
